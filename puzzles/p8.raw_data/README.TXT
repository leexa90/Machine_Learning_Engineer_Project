Thank you for downloading the raw data from the RNA Puzzles challenge!

There are two types of files in this directory:


--> Solution files: <N>_solution_<M>.pdb

    These are the coordinates of the solved crystal structure. Candidate models
    are compared against these coordinates.

    <N> -> stands for the challenge number.

    <M> -> stands for the TLS group number. Sometimes solution structures a
        presented with several TLSs we provide each of them separately.
        Candidate models are compared with both TLS groups and the smaller RMSD
        is kept.


--> Candidate model files: N_<lab name>_M.pdb

    These are the coordinates from the candidate models.

    <N> -> stands for the challenge number.

    <lab name> -> stands for the name of the participant group. The
        correspondent names and affiliations can be found at the "Participants"
        page:

            http://paradise-ibmc.u-strasbg.fr/rnapuzzles/participants.html

    <M> -> Candidate model number. Each participant group is allowed to send
        several candidate models that are identified by this number. For now
        the numbering is completly arbitrary and has no other meaning than
        identifying the different models.
